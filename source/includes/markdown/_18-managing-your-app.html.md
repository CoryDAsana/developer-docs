# Managing your App

### Duplicating an app

You can quickly create a brand new app with the same configurations of an existing one by selecting **Duplicate app**
in the [developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps).

This feature can help streamline the creation and management of different versions (e.g., staging, beta, production, etc.)
of your application. As a result of this operation, the newly-generated app will retain the configurations of the original app,
including:

* Basic information (e.g., app name, descriptions, authentication URL, etc.)
* Configurations of app components

Because the newly-generated app is its own unique app, the following _will not_ be carried over from the original app:

* App credentials (i.e., a new client ID and client secret will be generated)
* Users who have completed OAuth
* Organizations in which the app is available
* Published listings in the [app directory](https://asana.com/apps) or [app gallery](/docs/installation-flow)

### Editing a published app

Developers have the ability to submit edits to a published app.

To begin the process, first [duplicate your app](/docs/duplicating-an-app):

After duplicating the original app, provide any edits to any configurations as needed. 

When you are ready to [submit your app for review](/docs/submit-your-app), navigate to **Submit for review** in the
sidebar when managing your app. On the app submission page, select **I'm submitting changes to a published app** in
the **Submission type** dropdown:

Upon submission, your app will follow the standard review process. If the edits are accepted,
_the original (i.e., previous) app will reflect the new updates_, while the duplicate app can be used again for testing.
